42397,5716,en-GB,"<p>The nutrient emissions are calculated by the of the JRC's GREEN model. The GREEN (Geospatial Regression Equation for European Nutrient losses) is based on a simplified conceptual approach distinguishing the different pathways in which nutrients reach surface waters. According to this approach, diffuse sources, including fertiliser applications (both mineral and organic forms), scattered dwelling, atmospheric deposition, are first reduced in the soil matrix and then once in the stream they undergo further reduction due to in-stream retention processes, while point sources, which include waste water treatment plants, industrial effluents and runoff from paved areas, reach directly the streams and are thus reduced only by the stream retention process.  <br />In the model, the driver behind the nutrient losses is the annual precipitation and the retention in water is linked to the river length. <br />In this project only the Nutrient emissions of agricultural sources are used: the fertilizer applications. The application of mineral fertiliser and manure varies considerably across <br />European regions according to the production system, crop types, climatic conditions and soil characteristics. A reasonable estimation of fertiliser application at European level should consider these spatial variations. <br />The methodology applied and data used is described by FayÃ§al Bouraoui, Bruna Grizzetti and Alberto Aloe in <a href='http://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/111111111/8130/1/eur_fatescenario_baseline.pdf'>Nutrient discharge from rivers to seas for year 2000</a> (JRC Scientific and Technical Reports).

42402,5721,en-GB,"<p>The nutrient emissions are calculated by the of the JRC's GREEN model. The GREEN (Geospatial Regression Equation for European Nutrient losses) is based on a simplified conceptual approach distinguishing the different pathways in which nutrients reach surface waters. According to this approach, diffuse sources, including fertiliser applications (both mineral and organic forms), scattered dwelling, atmospheric deposition, are first reduced in the soil matrix and then once in the stream they undergo further reduction due to in-stream retention processes, while point sources, which include waste water treatment plants, industrial effluents and runoff from paved areas, reach directly the streams and are thus reduced only by the stream retention process. <br />In the model, the driver behind the nutrient losses is the annual precipitation and the retention in water is linked to the river length. <br />In this project only the Nutrient emissions of agricultural sources are used: the fertilizer applications. The application of mineral fertiliser and manure varies considerably across <br />European regions according to the production system, crop types, climatic conditions and soil characteristics. A reasonable estimation of fertiliser application at European level should consider these spatial variations. <br />The methodology applied and data used is described by FayÃ§al Bouraoui, Bruna Grizzetti and Alberto Aloe in <a href='http://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/bitstream/111111111/8130/1/eur_fatescenario_baseline.pdf'>Nutrient discharge from rivers to seas for year 2000</a> (JRC Scientific and Technical Reports).
